              Christian maturity is the aim of every believer and the goal is to
              reach "the very height of Christ's full stature" (Ephesians 4:13).
              In this course, we learn that although we cannot become completely
              like Christ, we are to reach for this highest of goals that the
              Bible sets for us, since this will enable us to achieve more than
              accomplishing a goal that is too low.

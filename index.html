                    <p>Christian maturity is the aim of every believer and the goal
                        is to reach "the very height of Christ's full stature"
                        (Ephesians 4:13). In this course, we learn
                        that although we cannot become completely like Christ, we are
                        to reach for this highest of goals that the Bible sets for us,
                        since this will enable us to achieve more than accomplishing a
                        goal that is too low.
